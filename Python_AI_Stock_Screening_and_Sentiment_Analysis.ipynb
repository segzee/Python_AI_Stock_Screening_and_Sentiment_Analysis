In this article, I'll show you how to use the finvizfinance Python library to find stocks that might be undervalued.

        "An operating margin is a profitability ratio that measures the percentage of revenue remaining after covering operating expenses. A positive operating margin suggests that a company is generating profit from its core operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Debt-to-Equity Ratio under 1:\n",
        "\n",
        "The debt-to-equity ratio is a financial metric that compares a company's total debt to its shareholders' equity. A ratio under 1 indicates that the company has less debt relative to its equity, which can be considered a positive financial sign.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Low Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio (under 1):\n",
        "\n",
        "The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to its book value (assets minus liabilities). A ratio under 1 suggests that the stock may be undervalued relative to its book value.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (under 15):\n",
        "\n",
        "The price-to-earnings ratio compares a company's current stock price to its earnings per share. A low P/E ratio relative to industry peers or historical values may indicate an undervalued stock.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Low Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) Ratio (under 1):\n",
        "\n",
        "The PEG ratio adjusts the traditional P/E ratio by factoring in the expected earnings growth rate. A PEG ratio under 1 is often considered favorable, indicating that the stock may be undervalued relative to its expected growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Positive Insider Transactions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Positive insider transactions indicate that company insiders (such as executives or employees) are buying shares of the company, which could be seen as a positive sign.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Market Cap in the Range of 'Small' ($300 million to $2 billion):\n",
        "\n",
        "Market capitalization (market cap) is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. 'Small' market cap, in this context, falls within the range of $300 million to $2 billion. Companies with smaller market caps may have more growth potential.\n",
